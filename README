This application serves as a proof of concept web portal for the management and regulation of clinical trials. The underlying infrastructure is a blockchain based architecture, with the benefits of immutability, full traceability, and data integrity. The portal mirrors a real and completed clinical trial to demonstrate its usefulness. Adverse events are automatically parsed out of the clinician completed case report form upon upload, and files are version controlled to discern files with the same name yet different content (similar to the idea of GitHub), allowing for user edits, and potentially exposing malicious data tampering. Validation hash checks are performed at the storage level as well to ensure that data has not been mutated. 

The blockchain in this simulation exists as multiple copies in one physical location on one machine. In reality, the blockchain will be duplicated and stored on multiple different machines, all controlled by the regulator, so that if one machine fails or is corrupted, the network data is not jeopardized. Consensus is simulated programatically as oppossed to introducing new hardware, which would be necessary if the proof of concept is to be fully productionized and made large scale. 


The portal can be found at: http://trialchain.ucsf.edu/.

All data elements from the portal are either extracted from the clinical data repository ImmPort: http://www.immport.org/immport-open/public/study/study/displayStudyDetail/SDY1
or simulated due to our lack of access to more safeguarded data.
