This application serves as a proof of concept web portal for the management and regulation of clinical trials. The underlying infrastructure is a blockchain based architecture, with the benefits of immutability, full traceability, and data integrity. The portal mirrors a real and completed clinical trial to demonstrate its usefulness. Adverse events are automatically parsed out of the clinician completed case report form upon upload, and files are version controlled to discern files with the same name yet different content (similar to the idea of GitHub), allowing for user edits, and potentially exposing malicious data tampering. Validation hash checks are performed at the storage level as well to ensure that data has not been mutated. 


The portal can be found at: http://trialchain.ucsf.edu/.
